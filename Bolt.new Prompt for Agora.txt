Create a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The application should integrate with Agora.io to provide the following features:

1. Interactive Live Streaming: Use the Agora RTC Web SDK to enable real-time video and audio streaming.
2. Flexible Classroom Environment: Implement features similar to a virtual classroom, including video conferencing, screen sharing, and participant management using the Agora RTC Web SDK.
3. Chat Functionality: Integrate the Agora RTM Web SDK for real-time messaging between users.
4. Interactive Whiteboard: Use the Agora Interactive Whiteboard Web SDK to allow collaborative drawing and annotation.

For the backend:
- Install and use the `agora-token` npm package to generate tokens for Agora RTC and RTM services.
- Implement API endpoints to generate these tokens when requested by the frontend.
- For the Interactive Whiteboard, implement token generation using the appropriate method, referencing Agora's documentation for generating Room Tokens and SDK Tokens.

Ensure that the application is set up to be production-ready, with proper error handling, security measures, and dynamic key generation for all integrated Agora services.

Please structure the application with clear separation between frontend and backend, and provide necessary code for integrating each Agora SDK feature.
